# Water Action News Reminder
I wrote this as practice as well as to remind myself to drink water.

**Prerequisites**
- Uses Notify-Send to push the notification
- Ensure you have libnotify installed on your Distro
  - https://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/fedora/35/x86_64/l/libnotify-0.7.9-5.fc35.i686.html
  - https://packages.ubuntu.com/impish/libnotify-bin

**Using WANR**
Download the files in the repository and set a cron job pointing to the .sh file

**Upcoming Changes**
- Building install script to put in ~./water_notify
- Attempting to research ways in which the user will not need to manually configure a cron job
